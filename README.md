This is a fork of DarthAffe's brilliant Keyboard Audio Visualiser. 

Check out his repo. This fork is only to make small variations that I want for my personal usages. Specifically, I only want the keyboard equaliser without loading in any other LEDs. 

Check out his repo for the actual code you want:
